# Pulse Reader for ESP12-F

This directory is intended for header files that may be included in the main source code of the ESP12-F pulse reader project.

As the project evolves, additional header files can be added here to modularize the code and improve maintainability.

Please refer to the main source file located in the `src` directory for the core functionality of the pulse reader.
